# VALENTINA - Background
# TODO: Valentina's history before the Resistance.
# Reference from stage.md: Colombian journalist, 27-29, Pariah/Conspiracy Theorist/Suspicious traits.
# How did she end up here? What shaped her paranoia? What does she know that others don't?
Valentina is a young investigative journalist who covered Colombian conflict, corruption, and cartel activities. In 2024-2025, she uncovered Servants infiltrating the Colombian government and published her findings. She was dismissed as a conspiracy theorist, her career was destroyed, and she was blacklisted from mainstream journalism.

When aliens and Servants were publicly revealed in 2026, she was vindicated - but too late to salvage her journalism career. The Resistance recruited her immediately, recognizing her investigative skills and her unfortunate expertise in being right about conspiracies nobody believed.

Now she obsessively documents everything, maintaining detailed records and cross-referencing information. She won't be dismissed as a conspiracy theorist again. She's paranoid about infiltration, constantly investigating council members (especially Wale), and questions whether Initiative or Protectorate agents have penetrated Resistance operations.

She shares a generational bond with Katya - both late 20s women with recent conflict trauma, both impatient with older councilors' caution. Wale regularly trolls her with absurd conspiracy theories ("The moon doesn't exist!" "Jun-ho is three children in a lab coat!"). She cannot comfortably dismiss them — her track record of being right has broken her ability to filter anything out. She hates that she can't. She investigates anyway. Some of his invented conspiracies have turned out to be real, which neither of them acknowledges. Katya takes bets on their exchanges.
