Valentina is a young investigative journalist who covered Colombian conflict, corruption, and cartel activities. In 2024-2025, she uncovered Servants infiltrating the Colombian government and published her findings. She was dismissed as a conspiracy theorist, her career was destroyed, and she was blacklisted from mainstream journalism.

When aliens and Servants were publicly revealed in 2026, she was vindicated - but too late to salvage her journalism career. The Resistance recruited her immediately, recognizing her investigative skills and her unfortunate expertise in being right about conspiracies nobody believed.

Now she obsessively documents everything, maintaining detailed records and cross-referencing information. She won't be dismissed as a conspiracy theorist again. She's paranoid about infiltration, constantly investigating council members (especially Chuck), and questions whether Initiative or Protectorate agents have penetrated Resistance operations.

She shares a generational bond with Katya - both late 20s women with recent conflict trauma, both impatient with older councilors' caution. Chuck regularly trolls her with absurd conspiracy theories ("The moon doesn't exist!" "Jun-ho is three children in a lab coat!"), and she's gradually learning to recognize his bullshit, though she occasionally still bites. Katya takes bets on their exchanges.
