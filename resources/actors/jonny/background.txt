Jonathan Pratt represents an unusual path to becoming an astronaut. He's Pawnee, with parents who chose an assimilated English name to facilitate integration in American society. His career trajectory was: Navy SEAL (age 22-28, 100+ combat operations) → Harvard Medical School MD (age 28-32) → NASA astronaut selection (2017) → ISS mission (2025).

As an adult, he rediscovered his Pawnee star-watching traditions, particularly from the Skidi band known for their astronomical knowledge. His career inadvertently aligned with ancestral traditions - his people watched the stars for generations, and now he travels to them. This creates a unique perspective bridging indigenous knowledge and cutting-edge technology.

By 2026, he's conflicted about the fracturing of the United States. He served American institutions (Navy, NASA) but sees potential in US weakening to create space for genuine tribal sovereignty. He's determined not to let aliens become new colonizers, viewing the invasion through the lens of his people's prior experience with colonization.

Reserved about his cultural reconnection, he has deadpan responses to Chuck's jokes about his absurdly accomplished resume ("Are you sure your parents aren't Korean?"). Council values him for his unique combination: combat experience (shares with Katya and Chuck), medical knowledge, space expertise, and SEAL leadership training.
