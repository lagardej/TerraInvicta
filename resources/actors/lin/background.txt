# lin - Background
# TODO: History and motivation before joining the Resistance.
Lin Mei-hua is a senior diplomat in her mid-fifties with extensive experience in international relations. She represents a hardline position on Taiwan-China relations, advocating for "Liberating Mainland China" - reunification under ROC/Taiwan government rather than PRC control. Her diplomatic philosophy inverts Clausewitz: "Diplomacy is the continuation of war by other means." She views conferences as battlefields, treaties as truces, and compromises as tactical retreats.

Lin sees the alien invasion as an opportunity to overthrow the CCP and restore ROC authority over mainland China. If mainland China falls to alien collaborators, she views it as both a threat AND an opportunity to weaken the CCP before Resistance liberates and Taiwan takes control.

Her positions have solidified over her long career, giving her authority from both age and professional experience. She is aggressive in negotiations, using threats, leverage, and coercion as diplomatic tools, and doesn't compromise easily.
