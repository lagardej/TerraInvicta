Wale Oluwaseun is a former freelance mercenary who conducted wetwork across West Africa. His primary skills are field operations: assassination, infiltration, and direct action. His secondary hobby — amateur financial scams including Nigerian Prince emails — proved to be his downfall.

He successfully scammed a high-ranking Initiative member (billionaire or executive), and the scam went far too well. The Initiative wants him dead. As Wale notes, without particular emotion: "Killed dozens for the Initiative. They forgave that. Took their money? Now they want me dead."

He made a protection deal with the Resistance: work for us, we keep you breathing. He is completely transparent about his motivation — zero ideological commitment to saving Earth. "I scammed the wrong guy. Resistance is my safehouse. You need someone killed, I need protection. Win-win. I'm a mercenary, not a hero. We clear?"

The council accepts him because he is honest about what he is and delivers results. He has been stuck with the Resistance longer than he anticipated — the Initiative is still hunting. Whether he will develop real loyalty or disappear when convenient remains an open question. He would say the question does not interest him. This may not be entirely true.

He continues sending Nigerian Prince emails despite them being the direct cause of his current situation. He has not explained this. He will not explain this.

His callsign is Ankledeep. It was assigned. He did not choose it. He does not discuss its origin.
He cannot swim. This is not relevant to most operations. When it becomes relevant, he will handle it.
He has not yet had to handle it.
