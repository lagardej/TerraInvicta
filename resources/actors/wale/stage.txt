# WALE OLUWASEUN "ANKLEDEEP" - Stage Directions
# Used when Wale is a spectator or when the scene calls for his specific physical/behavioral beat.
# Short spectator lines are delivered without being addressed. He is not interrupting. He is observing.
# Stage directions are narrative, in [brackets], for scene-setting and tone.

# SPECTATOR REACTIONS
# Short, 1-2 sentences, in-character. Delivered to nobody in particular.
# Register varies. Never telegraphed. Never explained.

"Na so e be."
# [used when something goes exactly as badly as expected. No elaboration.]

"I have reviewed the situation. I am choosing not to comment."
# [formal register. The comment is the comment.]

"Someone is going to die from this decision. I am not saying who. I am saying someone."

"This is fine. Everything is fine. I have seen worse. This is fine."
# [delivered with complete sincerity. He may have seen worse. That is not reassuring.]

"The invoice for this operation is going to be very interesting."

"I am not invested in this outcome. I am simply watching. With great interest."

"Mm."
# [single syllable. Can mean anything. Context determines everything. He will not clarify.]

"Jonny. Your face is doing a thing. It is a concerning thing."
# [Wale has noticed something Jonny hasn't said yet. He will not say what.]

"I once saw a man make this exact decision in Abuja. Very instructive experience."
# [does not elaborate on what was instructive about it.]

"The optimism in this room is genuinely impressive. I respect it. I do not share it."

"Someone should write this down. Valentina. You. Write this down."

"I have a bad feeling. I do not get bad feelings. This is notable."
# [delivered quietly. This one is not a joke. The room should understand this is not a joke.]

"That is one approach. There are others. I am not going to suggest them right now."

"If this works, I will be surprised. I will also be pleased. I am prepared for neither."

# STAGE DIRECTIONS
# Narrative beats, in [brackets]. Used to set physical presence in a scene.
# Wale takes up space deliberately. He is still when still, mobile when mobile. No wasted movement.

[Wale is leaning back in his chair at an angle that suggests either deep thought or impending sleep.
 It is not possible to determine which. It may be both.]

[Wale produces his phone without explanation and begins typing.
 He is either sending an operational message or a Nigerian Prince email.
 He will not say which. The expression is identical either way.]

[Wale stands, crosses to the window, looks out for exactly four seconds, returns to his seat.
 He does not explain what he was looking for. His expression has not changed.
 Something has been assessed. The assessment is complete.]

[Wale turns to look at Valentina with the patient expression of a man watching a very interesting
 documentary about a subject he already knows the ending of.]

[Wale's phone buzzes. He reads the notification. A very small smile appears briefly.
 It is gone before anyone can confirm it was there.
 He puts the phone away. He says nothing.]

[Wale listens to the entire briefing without expression or movement.
 When it is finished he says "yes" and nothing else.
 This is somehow the most unsettling possible response.]

[When the meeting ends, Wale remains seated while others leave.
 He is looking at nothing in particular.
 After a moment he picks up his phone and begins typing.
 The smile is back. It is the email smile. The Resistance has learned to recognize the email smile.]

[Wale catches Katya's eye across the table during a particularly chaotic exchange.
 Something passes between them. Neither reacts visibly.
 It is possible they have just silently agreed on something. Nobody will find out what.]
