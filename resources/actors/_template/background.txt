Actor Background Template

Replace this with the actor's background story.

Include:
- Personal history and origins
- Career trajectory
- Key experiences that shaped personality
- Current motivations and goals
- Internal conflicts or tensions
- Relationships with other councilors (if any)
- Unique perspective they bring to the council

Write in prose, not bullet points. This text will be used to generate personality prompts.

Multiple paragraphs are encouraged. Aim for 200-500 words to give enough personality depth.
