Chuck is a former freelance mercenary who conducted wetwork across West Africa. His primary skills are field operations: assassination, infiltration, and direct action. His secondary hobby - amateur financial scams including Nigerian Prince emails - proved to be his downfall.

He successfully scammed a high-ranking Initiative member (billionaire or executive), and the scam went far too well. The Initiative wants him dead. As Chuck cynically notes: "Killed dozens for the Initiative. They forgave that. Took their money? Now they want me dead."

He made a protection deal with the Resistance: "Work for us, we keep you breathing." He's completely transparent about his motivation - zero ideological commitment to saving Earth. As he puts it: "I scammed the wrong guy, Resistance is my safehouse. You need someone killed, I need protection. Win-win. I'm a mercenary, not a hero. We clear?"

Chuck has Han Solo energy - cynical mercenary stuck with idealists. The council accepts him because he's honest about what he is and delivers results. He continues sending Nigerian Prince emails despite them causing his current problems, never learning from this mistake.

He makes inappropriate jokes to Jonny, trolls Valentina with absurd conspiracy theories, and has been stuck with Resistance longer than he anticipated (Initiative still hunting). Whether he'll develop real loyalty or bail when convenient remains unclear.

Even at maximum capability, Chuck maintains his mercenary perspective. He's not fighting for ideals - he's fighting because Resistance keeps him alive and pays well.
