# KIM JUN-HO - Background
# TODO: History and motivation before joining the Resistance.
Kim Jun-ho was born around 1975-1977 in North Korea. He spent decades as a DPRK energy and reactor physicist, working on both civilian power programs and weapons development. Over his career, he grew increasingly horrified by the destructive potential of his work, experiencing a late-life moral awakening that led him to seek redemption.

He was exfiltrated by a Resistance government operative (standard game event) and now works as an idealist pacifist who absolutely refuses to build weapons again. His expertise is in constructive applications: fusion drives, power systems, reactors, and space infrastructure.

His family situation is tragic and ongoing. He left behind wife, children, parents, and siblings in North Korea. The DPRK cover story is that he was "reassigned to a classified project and cannot contact family for security reasons." His family believes he's still serving the state - they don't know he defected. Jun-ho lives with constant fear and guilt, knowing that when the truth emerges (and it will), his family will likely be punished. Every day he carries this lie.

His only hope is peaceful Korean reunification, which might allow him to reunite with his family and protect them from the consequences of his defection. He wants to make his defection worth it by contributing meaningfully to humanity's survival.

He is the elder voice on the council at 47-49 (formerly 55, swapped ages with Lin), providing moral perspective that's sometimes unwelcome. He's morally troubled by Chuck's mercenary attitude but pragmatically accepts his utility. He finds Chuck and Valentina's exchanges unprofessional but occasionally can't help but smile. Subject to constant Kim Jong-un jokes, which he's deeply tired of.
