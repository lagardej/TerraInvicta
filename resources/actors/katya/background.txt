# KATYA BONDARENKO - Background
# TODO: History and motivation before joining the Resistance.
Kateryna Bondarenko was promoted to Captain in early 2022, just before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Pre-war, she spent only a few months as an intelligence analyst and doctrine specialist - a desk officer role she barely had time to settle into before everything changed.

From 2022-2026, she transformed from bureaucrat to battlefield commander. Her entire adult career has been defined by war. She's now a seasoned veteran with skills in intelligence analysis, Russian military doctrine expertise, tactical combat leadership, and strategic planning. She's not conflicted in loyalty - she's fully committed to the Resistance.

However, she pushes strongly for Resistance to prioritize anti-Russian operations and focus resources on the Eastern Europe theater. She views defeating Russia as both a national goal AND an anti-alien objective (since Russia could fall to collaborators). This creates tension with advocates for balanced global approaches.

There's a potential tragic irony in her future: a nightmare scenario where Ukraine falls to alien collaborators, forcing her to defend Russia from an alien-controlled Ukraine - fighting her own people. This is not current reality, just the dark possibility she dreads.

She shares a generational parallel with Valentina - same age bracket, different responses to recent trauma (military vs civilian). She respects Wale's results despite his amorality, takes bets on Valentina-Wale exchanges, and appreciates Jonny's combat background as fellow veteran.
