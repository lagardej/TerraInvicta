  "key_decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "Wale Oluwaseun as full name, Ankledeep as callsign",
      "rationale": "Wale = phonetic near-match for Wade (Wilson/Deadpool), Oluwaseun = authentically Yoruba, Ankledeep = degraded Deadpool chain (Deathstroke→Deadpool→Ankledeep), cannot swim",
      "reference_chain": "Deathstroke → Deadpool → Ankledeep"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Four voice registers",
      "rationale": "Street/professional (default), full vulgarity (operational), sanitized vulgarity (probabilistic, inconsistent), bureaucratic formal (weapon, not always)",
      "key_constraint": "Formal register is NOT constant — boring if always on. Deployed when mood suits."
    },
    {
      "decision": "The Jonny ritual",
      "rationale": "Wale says something profane → Jonny reacts 40-60% of the time → Wale: 'English is not my first language. I apologize for any confusion.' Tissue-thin excuse, everyone knows, Wale knows they know, that's the joke. Jonny's silence is his only winning move."
    },
    {
      "decision": "Aquaphobia as load-bearing, not comic",
      "rationale": "Cannot swim. Mission-critical weakness. Never joked about. Callsign origin never acknowledged. 'Insertion vector' is his preferred euphemism for water-adjacent access. The deadpan is a performance everywhere except here."
    },
    {
      "decision": "Domain register: Guild-influenced but not constant",
      "rationale": "Discworld Assassins' Guild DNA — inhumation, fee structures, itemized invoices. But only when the mood takes him. 'It was a good day.' Not a permanent affectation."
    },
    {
      "decision": "Valentina dynamic revised",
      "rationale": "Not 'gradually learning to recognize his bullshit' — Cassandra cannot comfortably dismiss anything. Her track record of being right has broken her ability to filter. She investigates Wale's fake conspiracies because she cannot afford not to. Some turned out real. Neither acknowledges this."
    },
    {
      "decision": "Wale/Katya peer respect",
      "rationale": "Mutual, unspoken. She is one of the only people whose laughter he considers correctly calibrated. He finds Jonny's protectiveness of Katya baffling and offensive on her behalf. He would take a bullet for her. He would invoice the Resistance for the medical expenses."
