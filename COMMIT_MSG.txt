Update FEATURES.md roadmap to reflect current implementation

Changes:
- Mark completed features (unified build system, SQLite pipeline, safety checks)
- Update technical specs (1060 lines, 7 commands, <1s pipeline)
- Revise tier prompts approach (tier templates + actor overlays)
- Add CODEX tier evaluation specification with unlock conditions
- Expand context extraction roadmap (full gamestate coverage)
- Document domain routing phases (keyword → embedding)
- Add performance monitoring implementation
- Reorganize by status (completed → planned → ideas)
- Remove outdated sections (template optimization superseded by SQLite)

Status:
- Completed: Build system, data pipeline, OS configs, safety
- High Priority: Tier prompts, CODEX evaluation, domain routing
- Medium Priority: Context extraction, performance monitoring
- Low Priority: Examples, validation, advanced features

Next: Implement tier-specific prompt system
