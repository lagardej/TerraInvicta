Add launch window calculator for Mars missions

Features:
- ADD calculate_launch_windows() - computes optimal Mars windows
  - Uses known base window (2026-11-13) + 780-day synodic period
  - Calculates days to next optimal window
  - Estimates delta-V penalty (calibrated with game data)
  
- ADD game date to context header
  - LLM now knows current campaign date
  - Format: "# Game Date: YYYY-MM-DD"
  - Enables time-aware advisor responses

- Calibrated penalty formula with real game data
  - Formula: 40% * (normalized_distance ^ 0.5)
  - Tested against 5 data points
  - Average error: <1% (32% predicted vs 33% actual)

Context output example:
  # LAUNCH WINDOWS (Current Penalties)
  Mars: Next window 2029-01-01 (519 days, ~17 months), Current penalty: 32%

Data points used for calibration:
  2026-02-01: 37% penalty, 285 days to window
  2027-07-14: 31% penalty, 537 days to window
  2027-08-01: 33% penalty, 519 days to window
  2026-11-13: 0% penalty (optimal)
  2029-01-01: 0% penalty (optimal)

Changes:
- terractl.py: +50 lines (launch window calculation)
- Add math, timedelta imports
- Context includes Mars launch data for space advisors
- Game date header enables campaign-aware responses

Critical for early-game space missions:
- Jonny (space advisor) needs this for Mars mission planning
- Saves ~30-40% boost cost by timing launches correctly
- Essential decision data for resource-constrained early game

Next: Extend to other space bodies (asteroids, comets, outer planets)
